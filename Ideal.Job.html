						<p>My Ideal job is to become a Cyber Security Analyst,</p>
             <p>I have listed my ideal job below, however sadly this job has now been taken off seek where i found it last week already, I have included this job as the main reason behind it is because of the company Insane Technology which is organised and run by an old friend David Rudduck who i was friend with over few years as our interest for the Toyota Supra was very strong and we got on quite well.</p>
             <p>Cyber Security has always interested me as it is a really good way to stop those criminals digitally and protecting the public safe, Security Analyst's main job is to keep intruders, attackers or hackers out of networks in order to protect digital files and information systems against unauthorized access.</p>
             <p>The skills and qualifications for this role within the company basically designed around someone who is going out to the client as needs to know what they are doing when it comes to any form of operating system, networking programs aswell as programs relating to virus protection and trojan protection with a need for programming the systems to protect them aswell.</p>
             <p>When looking to become a cyber security specialist with my current skills being zero, I have alot to learn, master and obtain in the field i know it is possible.</p>
             <p>The way for myself to obtain the skills to achieve a position within the company will require myself to go through my Bachelor Degree in IT and branch off it into Cyber Security aswell as learning such technology they all use in day to day activities also a forever growing list of qualifications as they change, some of the qualifications they hold include the following :- </p>
            <p> GCFA Certified (Forensic Analyst), COMP-TIA, CCNA, OSCP, Security+, CCNP.  </p>
