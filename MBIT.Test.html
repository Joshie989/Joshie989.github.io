						<p>After Conducting the 16 personality test, big five personality and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test I have found that a few different scores have provided great feedback not only in the way i am but also the way i look at others in day to day life. </p>
             <p>My results listed below will have a very positive feedback on someone who is a very well spoken and strong personality who doesnt mind being in charge, When i sitback and then give my feedback in relation to the question or statement i believe a free speaker or creative person would have a hard time when dealing with this as any idea they recieve in there mind they want to talk about where as i just want to listen to everything infront of myself before i go off and do things, very similar to this project where i went for the looks of a website before the actual content was printed.</p>
             <p>When forming a team the 3 test below have given me an insite in towards how i would definately not go well with a very dominating personality, I also like to sit back and listen to all the facts and evidence when making a decision, A free creative thinker would possibly find this very hard to deal with this even when i will achieve the same outcome as they do just in a different way.</p>
             <p>The Myers-Brigg Test has taught and informed me that i am a kind and caring personality who would rather care about others feelings rather than a paycheck and a result, I feel this is my biggest learning curve over everything else that i have found out durring the test.</p>
