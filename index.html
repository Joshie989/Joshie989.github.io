						<p id="content-2"> The whole thing with Information Technology is it has always been around myself, from a very young age I remember always having a console controller in my hand, The earliest time of this that i remember is around the age of 5 years old being a Super Nintendo console however it went on from there.
							After that was a Comodore 64 with DOS and having to manually type everything in was next, Overall though it wassnt till the experience was within high school i was interested in working for Electronic Arts which was based Melbourne at the time as a software enginee, That was till that sad day in Year 10 (early 1998), I spoke to a head designer of software and this is where they crushed my dreams on the spot, stating the chinese and japanese boys and girls will be studying 10-14 hours a day and do i see myself doing this for a career, i declined and just went about my day to day life till today. There has been a huge gap in my IT field of play with mainly just playing of computers aswell as building my own personal computer for Car Racing Games. 
							RMIT seems like the perfect placed course where i will gain exposure and hopoefully define which field i will pursue within the 3 year time frame and that was i am in for a fun and loving career within something i am Passionate about in day to day life.</p>
