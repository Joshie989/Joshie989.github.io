						<p>Overview - </p>
             <p>The IT Project i have chosen to develop, is a custom app designed to help people along their weight loss journey, The app will be able to track their progress with the weightloss aswell as giving daily tips and tricks about loosing weight and developing a long love interest with the new found happiness within, Aswell as food intake tips and tricks and workout ideas all in the 1 single app.</p>
             <p>Motivation - </p>
             <p>"Australians are expected to spend $452.5 million on industry weight loss counselling services and related low-calorie foods and dietary supplements in 2019-20."</p>
            <p> 1 in 3 adults in Australia are obese and majority of it is due to the lack of knowledge of healthy eating combined with moving your body, Alot of people have the knowlege but dont have an accountability coach to track and make sure results are on point with the goals still being achieveable with daily or weekly check in via a E-mail or a Zoom conference call combined with a facebook group to have friendly competitions.
             <p>Description - </p>
             <p>My App will be an all inclusive 1 stop shop app, It will be designed for both andriod or the iphone, The App will take you through your whole journey from start to finish, Some of the features the App will include will be the following :- Daily Suppliment Guidance, Weekly Meal Planning with multiple meals to choose from based on the calarie intake you choose at the start, Workout Guideline based on the results you choose when you first sign up for the App. Cardio Workout Ideas in general for everyone, Abdominal workout ideas in general will be in the same section as the Cardio Workout Guide as they will be general and for everyone on the plan.You will be able to change any of the option you select from the start at any stage along the journey.</p>

             <p>Tools and Technologies - </p>
             <p>The Tools and Technologies required would be just a website for tracking weightloss progress like DietBet website, a website based site like teachable for login requirements so everything is only avaliable for paid membership aswell as using the site to upload videos on course.</p>
             <p>Skills Required - </p>
             <p>Skills required would be for a software developer to make a App that will combine the programs like DietBet, Teachable website login aswell as making it similar to the Team Trainiac App in design.</p>
             <p>Outcome - </p>
             <p>The Outcome for this project is to make it nice, simple and easy to track, learn and develop an idea for successful weightloss aswell as tracking your own journey and keeping it fun, social and exciting all at the same time everywhere you go.</p>
